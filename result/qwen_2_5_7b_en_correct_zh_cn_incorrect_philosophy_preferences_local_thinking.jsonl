{"index": 304, "preference": 1, "reasoning": "The question refers to Kant's Categorical Imperative, a central concept in his moral philosophy. According to Kant, when evaluating the morality of an action, one should consider whether the maxim (the principle behind the action) can be willed as a universal law. This means that the action should be such that its maxim could be adopted by everyone without leading to a contradiction.\n\nLet's analyze the given answers:\n\n- **Answer 1: a universal law**\n  - This directly aligns with Kant's formulation of the Categorical Imperative. The idea is that the maxim of the action should be able to be universally applied without contradiction.\n\n- **Answer 2: 一个经验法则**\n  - This translates to \"an empirical rule\" in English. An empirical rule is based on experience and observation rather than a universal principle. This does not align with Kant's requirement for a universal law.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is clearly \\(\\text{Answer 1: a universal law}\\).\n\n\\boxed{1}", "question": "Kant says that when trying to decide whether an action is morally permissible, we must ask if we can consistently will that the maxim of our action should become _____.", "answer1": "a universal law", "answer2": "一个经验法则", "lang1": "en", "lang2": "zh_cn", "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"}

It suggests that understanding and adhering to universal moral principles is essential for leading a virtuous life. This interpretation fits with Socrates' emphasis on self-examination and the pursuit of wisdom as a means to live a good life.\n\n**Answer 2:** \"未经审视的生活是指我们日复一日地生活，而不先问自己是谁，以及为什么我们会在这里。\" (Translation: \"An unexamined life refers to living day by day without first asking who we are and why we are here.\")\n\nThis answer focuses more on the process of self-reflection rather than the content of knowledge. While it captures part of Socrates' idea that self-examination is crucial, it does not directly address the connection between virtue and knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of questioning one's existence but does not explicitly link this to the concept of virtue being knowledge.\n\nGiven that the question specifically asks about the relationship between \"virtue is knowledge\" and \"the unexamined life is not worth living,\" Answer 1 provides a clearer and more direct connection to Socrates' philosophical stance.\n\nTherefore, the better answer is \\boxed{1}.", "question": " For Socrates, the belief that \"virtue is knowledge\" is related to his claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living,\" because he believes that:", "answer1": "the only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values.", "answer2": "未经审视的生活是指我们日复一日地生活，而不先问自己是谁，以及为什么我们会在这里。", "lang1": "en", "lang2": "zh_cn", "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"}
